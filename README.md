# Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio

# About me
Growing up, I was always taking things apart, driven by a curiosity to
figure out how and why they worked, often with the goal to improve
them in some way when reassembling them. Sometimes it worked,
sometimes it didn’t. As frustrating as the latter can be, this is where I
began to appreciate how failure is our best teacher if we are open to
learning from it.
My scholarly endeavors and research in economics, mathematics,
and statistics were successful, in part, because of my curiosity in
learning how things work, seeking opportunities for improvement,
and having the perseverance or “grit” to follow through. I absolutely
needed this grit to successfully complete and defend my doctoral
dissertation while simultaneously embarking on my full time
professional career.
Professionally, these qualities serve me well in applying predictive
analytics and data science to solve business problems and improve
decision making. Whether it’s developing and implementing machine
learning predictive algorithms, building econometric models to
measure program incremental impact, or crafting experimental
designs to test marketing campaign effectiveness, the satisfaction
I get from delivering tangible analytic results is often surpassed by
the process itself. Both as an individual contributor and as a people
leader, I thoroughly enjoy working with talented, like-minded people
in designing solutions, building them out, and sharing the results and
discoveries with others.
Over my career, I’ve learned that successfully driving analytic
results often comes in small packages. I’ve observed that small
analytic teams of 5 to 6 people leveraging Agile or Agile-like project
management approaches tend to deliver results faster, be more
collaborative, and better align with the needs and goals of business
users.
I’ve had the good fortune to use a variety of tools on my analytic
journey, including SAS, R, Python, SQL, and Power BI. Outside of
analytic coding, I enjoy tinkering with Python and Docker containers
to create home automation and other nifty applications. Away
from the computer, I enjoy hiking, biking, and artistic activities like
drawing/sketching and improving my guitar playing technique.
Please feel free to contact me via LinkedIn. I’m always looking
forward to learning from others about new ideas, opportunities, or
maybe even virtual jam sessions!
